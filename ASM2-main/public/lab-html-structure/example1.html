        PHOTOSHOOT EFFECT </h1>
    <p>In this tutorial, we are creating a photo shoot effect with our just-released PhotoShoot jQuery plug-in. With it
        you can convert a regular div or the page into a photo shooting stage simulating a camera-like feel.</p>
    <p>Potential clients want to see how they’ll be working with. They want to see people, not stock photography. We
        produced a custom photo shoot to bring the people of Paterson Buchanan front and center and to underscore the
        firm’s open and welcoming style. Vivid images illustrate Paterson Buchanan’s wide range of clients, as well as
        their commitment to the picturesque region the firm serves.</p>
